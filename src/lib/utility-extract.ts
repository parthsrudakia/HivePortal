/**
 * Utility statement extraction — Claude reads an uploaded statement (PDF or
 * photo) and returns structured bill data: provider, utility type, service
 * period, which of our units it belongs to, and the current cycle's charges.
 *
 * Rules enforced in the prompt and schema:
 *  - Previous balance / payments received / amount carried forward are
 *    IGNORED — only charges billed for the current cycle are extracted.
 *  - Late fees and any other non-usage charges come back as separate line
 *    items (kind 'late_fee' / 'other') so they can be tracked individually.
